Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. Airbnb is available in 191+ countries and operates an online hosting market, mainly homestays for vacation rentals and tourist activities. It is headquartered in San Francisco, California.

This project aims to understand the market of apartament's and house's rent exploring data of airBnB rents in Seattle. In order to understand the behavior of the market and its characteristics 3 questions will be answered:

1. How much Airbnb homes are earning in certain time frames and areas?
2. Earnings are increasing or decresing? and is it the price ou the days rented the reason for the variation?
3. Which are the most common amenities?

The inspiration for this project is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data), but since the data was from 2016, data from 2021 was downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.

## Summary of results:

1. Second semester indicates an incrase for earnings/rent for airbnb in Seattle between the most popular neighbourhoods in number of rents.
2. Price and days not available impacts positively the increase of earnings in the second semester. Price increases 66% comparing december and january, but the number of days not available increases even more, with a 162% increase.
3. The 10 most common facilities are: Wifi, Smoke Alarms, Essentials, Heating, Hair Dryer, Shampoo, Carbon Moxide Alarm, Long Term Stays Allowed and Kitchen
