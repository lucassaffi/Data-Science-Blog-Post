Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. Airbnb is available in 191+ countries and operates an online hosting market, mainly homestays for vacation rentals and tourist activities. It is headquartered in San Francisco, California.

This project aims to understand the market of apartament's and house's rent exploring data of airBnB rents in Seattle. In order to understand the behavior of the market and its characteristics 3 questions will be answered:

1. How much AirBNB homes are earning in certain time frames and areas?

2. Is increasing or decresing? and is it the price ou the days rented the reason for the variation?

3. Which are the most common amenities?
